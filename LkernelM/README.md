# NTU_CE3003_Loadable-Kernel-Module-Programming
The following practical exercises are designed to enable students to practice techniques involved in Loadable Kernel Module (LKM) programming. First part of the exercises can be done on an Ubuntu based PC in order to get familiarized with the LKM development process. Once the code is shown to be operating properly, it is then transferred to the RPi3 for further development.
